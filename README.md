A user called, "Why is my server not working?  A walk through scenario with Windows or Linux VMs "`problems`". Let's see if we can pinpoint what's bothering them by using the built in troubleshooting workbench to show and prove the forensics, and to deep dive in to the single metrics to compare and do a little *coincidence detection* :
>  - CPU problems. Get the full overview of usage, Co-Stop, CPU Ready, and contention. 
>  - Memory contention, do we need to add memory?
>  - Disk IO, latency, is this what's slowing down your application?

We will use our Lab to Create and Modify Views, Dashboards and Reports. These topics will be covered:

> - *DASHBOARDS*: We will build a dashboard for your Monday morning investigation to spend less time on operations. Let the Manager, Developer, or application owners do their own operations by sharing our dashboards. 
> - *REPORTS*: Create reports, the static blood samples of operations
