# Aria Operations Experience Day

Welcome to the Aria Operations Experience Day Lab Manual! This dynamic event offers a 50/50 blend of Show and Tell sessions and immersive Hands-on Labs, focusing on **Dashboard Building and Troubleshooting**. 

# Agenda

## 08:30 Introduction to Aria Operations
Walkthrough and introduction to what's possible with this self driving operations tool, such as Proactive Management, Optimize resources, Cost Management, Automate tasks, Integrations, Custom dashboards

## 09:30 Recommendations, Reclaim and Right Size 
You can follow this by using your own pod / **Hands-On Labs**. Before diving into dashboard creation, we will explore essential capabilities to effectively utilize Aria Operations.

> - **Recommendations: Anticipate the Future:** Explore predictive insights for proactive decisions.
> - **Resource Optimization: Reclaim and Stop Waste:** Identify and manage recoverable resources, snapshots, and disconnected disks.
> - **Rightsizing Strategies: Optimize Resources:** Navigate internal dynamics and delay hardware investments by optimizing existing resources.
> - **Strategic Capacity Planning: Timing Hardware Investments:** Use data-driven insights to determine the right time for new hardware investments.

## 10:15 Coffee break

## 10:30 Deep dive troubleshooting 
We'll explore troubleshooting techniques using Windows or Linux VMs as examples. By utilizing the built-in troubleshooting workbench, we'll uncover the root causes affecting the application VMs. Our objective is to demonstrate the forensic process and conduct an in-depth analysis of single metrics, utilizing coincidence detection for precision:
>  - **CPU Troubles: Unveiling Usage, Co-Stop, and Contention**. 
>  - **Memory Contention: Evaluating Memory Needs**
>  - **Disk IO Latency: Uncovering Performance Hitches**?

## 12:00 LUNCH BREAK 

## 13:00 LAB Exercise! 
**Crafting Views, Dashboards, and Reports**: Here's what we will cover:

> - **Views: Visual Insights and Dashboard Integration** Explore effective views and how to integrate them into dashboards.
> - **Dashboards: Streamlining Operations** Build a dashboard for efficient Monday morning investigations. Share with stakeholders for self-service operations.
> - **Bonus: Reports for Snapshots** Time permitting, create reports to capture operational snapshots for analysis.

## 14:00 Environmental friendly operations
**Sustainability dashboards** in Aria Operations provide a way to monitor, analyze, and optimize the environmental impact of your infrastructure.Track energy consumption, resource utilization, and carbon footprint. We will have a look at the built in system and show some additional dashboards built by other VMware Employees available for download and use. 

## 15:01 Go home. Drive safe! bye!
